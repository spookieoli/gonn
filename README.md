# goNN

A Go (Golang) library to create neural networks

Project Objectives:

* Easy to use - (Tensorflow *like* syntax)
* Fast training -> even on larger networks
* Fast inference -> even on larger networks
* Models can be saved (model.save())
* Models can be loaded (model.load())
* Advanced layers like CONV, GRU..
* Production readiness :)
* 100% Go

Examples:

TBD
